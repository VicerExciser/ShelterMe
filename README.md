We want to help answer questions like:
  - Where is the nearest shelter to the user's current location?
  - What gender or ages do nearby shelters house?
  - How can the shelters be contacted?
  - Do they currently have available beds?
  
Necessary shelter data to collect for each:
  - Unique key (These numbers are meaningless outside of this app and should not be visible to the users)
  - Shelter Name
  - Capacity (for individuals or for families)
  - Restrictions
    -- Age (Families w/ newborns, Children, Yound Adults, Anyone)
    -- Gender (Male, Female, Anyone)
    -- Families (Yes/No)
    -- Veterans only (Yes/No)
  - Location (latitude, longitude, street address)
  - Special notes
  - Phone Number (in (000) 000-0000 format)
  - Other contact information, such as a web address
